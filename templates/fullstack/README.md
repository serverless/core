# Serverless Fullstack

A fullstack application built on Serverless Components via the Serverless Framework

**Demo:** [ServerlessFullstack.com](https://serverless-fullstack.com/)

## Quick-Start

* Install npm dependencies in the `dashboard` and `api` via `npm i`

* If you would like to add a custom domain and SSL certificate, first purchase a custom domain on AWS Route 53, wait until domain registration has finished, then add it into `serverless.yml` by following the instructions in that file.

* Run `serverless`

* Run `serverless --debug` if you want to see what's happening behind the scenes.
