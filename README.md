⚡️ Updates: <a href="https://github.com/serverless/components/releases/tag/0.1.22">v0.1.22 has been released</a> - Includes the function & api provider agnostic components.

<br/>

Forget infrastructure.  Serverless Components enable you to create reusable use-cases out of cloud services, like a *blog*, a *user registration system*, a *payment system* or an *entire application*.

You can use them via the [Serverless Framework](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless).

# Features

#### Simplicity

Serverless Components are mostly built around higher-order use-cases (e.g. a website, blog, payment system).  Irrelevant low-level infrastructure details are abstracted away, and simpler configuration is offered instead.

```yaml
# serverless.yml

website:
  component: @serverless/website@2.0.5
  inputs:
    code:
      src: ./src
```

#### Composition

Serverless Components are easy to compose.  You can compose them declaratively via YAML (**serverless.yml**) or programatically via javascript (**serverless.js**).

```yaml
# serverless.yml

backend:
  component: @serverless/backend
  inputs:
    code:
      src: ./backend

website:
  component: @serverless/website
  inputs:
    code:
      src: ./frontend
    env:
      api: ${backend.url} # An output from "backend" to make available in the website
```

```javascript
// serverless.js

MyComponent extends Component {
  async default() {
    const website = await this.load('@serverless/website') // Load a component
    const outputs = await website({ code: { src: './src' } }) // Deploy it
    this.state.url = outputs.url
    await this.save()
    return outputs
  }
}
```

#### Serverless & Vendor-Agnostic

Serverless Components favor cloud services with serverless qualities (shocker!) across all vendors, like AWS Lambda, AWS S3, Azure Functions, Google Big Query, Twilio, Stripe, Algolia, Cloudflare Workers and more.

#### Fast Deployments

Most Serverless Componetns deploy 10x faster than traditional cloud provisioning tools.  One of Serverless Components' goals is to deploy near instantly, removing the need to emulate clodu services locally.

#### Vanilla Javascript

Serverless Components are written in vanilla javascript and seek to use the least amount of dependencies and fads, enabling ease of understanding by both beginning and fatigued javascripters.

<br/>

# Getting Started

Install the [Serverless Framework](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless).

```shell
$ npm i -g serverless
```

Serverless Components can written by anyone, but you can see several [available Components here](https://www.github.com/serverless-components).

# Declarative Usage

If you want to compose components together and deploy them, you can do it declaratively via the Serverless Framework's `serverless.yml` file, like this:

```yml
name: my-stack

website: # An instance of a component.
  component: @serverless/website@2.0.5 # The component you want to create an instance of.
  inputs: # Inputs to pass into the component.
    code:
      src: ./src
```

Deploy everything with:

```shell
$ serverless # Deploys the components...
```
